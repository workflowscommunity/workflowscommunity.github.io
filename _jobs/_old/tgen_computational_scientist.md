## Computational Scientist
The Barthel Laboratory is a cancer genomics lab focused on utilizing state-of-the-art genomic approaches to study the development and evolution of glial brain tumors (gliomas). The lab has a particular interest in the fundamental role of telomere dysfunction in glioma development, but is generally interested in all aspects of tumor evolution including but not limited to longitudinal studies of therapy response assessed by genomic analyses of tissue samples and liquid biopsies. The lab has received both government (eg. National Institutes of Health) and philanthropic funding for several translational and basic science research projects in this domain. We are looking for a talented, passionate and highly motivated individual to enrich our team to lead the computational efforts in our group.


## Position Summary
The Computational Scientist will work on multiple projects analyzing biomedical data by applying existing tools, informatics resources, and developing new software and tools. They will be responsible for automating, optimizing and customizing existing bioinformatics workflows; implementing novel analytical approaches and developing professional-grade reusable software resources for medium-to-large scale research projects. They will be involved in all aspects of data analysis and interpretation and provide mentorship to trainees looking to acquire dry-lab skills. They will collaborate with bench scientists to validate computational findings using molecular biology approaches to develop in vitro models to test new hypotheses.


## Location
We are located at the Translational Genomics Institute (TGen), a non-profit research institute located in Phoenix, Arizona that is set to the backdrop of the stunning Sonoran Desert. Phoenix is the 5th largest city in the nation, the fastest growing for 5 years in a row and ranked 5th in the Nation as an Emerging Life Science Market. Phoenix's unprecedented growth in the life sciences is fueled by over $3.25 billion in capital investment which has led to over 5 million square feet of new bioscience healthcare facilities constructed since 2019. At the heart of this growth is a 30-acre urban life sciences center - the Phoenix Biomedical Campus (PBC), at which TGen sits at the center.

Phoenix additionally boasts an incredibly comfortable lifestyle averaging over 300 sunny days a year, multiple mountain ranges in near proximity and some of the most magnificent national and state parks in the nation within driving range. The airport is ranked as one of the best in the country in terms of passenger satisfaction owing to fast moving lines at security checkpoints, and moreover is a mere 10-minute drive from TGen, making traveling to anywhere in the world a breeze.
