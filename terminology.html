            <p>This terminology represents a collaborative effort by the <a href="/groups/terminology">Scientific
                    Workflow Systems Terminology Working Group</a> to create a standardized framework for understanding
                and comparing the diverse landscape of workflow management systems (WMSs). Developed through extensive
                community engagement involving workflow system developers, domain scientists, and practitioners from the
                Workflows Community Initiative. Rather than attempting to rank or recommend specific systems, this
                terminology provides researchers with objective criteria to systematically evaluate and select workflow
                management systems that best match their computational requirements, infrastructure constraints, and
                scientific objectives. By establishing a common vocabulary, we aim to move beyond subjective system
                selection based solely on familiarity or reputation, enabling more informed, technically-grounded
                decisions in the scientific computing community.</p>

            <p>This framework organizes workflow systems along five key axes discussed below.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row gy-4 mb-5">
            <a name="workflow-characteristics"></a>
            <h4>Workflow Characteristics</h4>
            <p>This axis examines fundamental organizational aspects that impact how workflows operate and adapt.
                Specifically, it examines how execution is driven (by tasks or data), the level of complexity of
                individual components, the nature of dependencies between these components, and the ability to modify
                execution paths at runtime. These structural elements significantly influence how WMSs optimize resource
                use and performance.</p>
            <img src="/images/terminology/workflow_characteristics.svg" />
            <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                <li><strong>Flow</strong>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                        <li><strong>Task:</strong> When workflow components receive inputs, process them, generate
                            outputs, and then terminate, the workflow structure is defined by the composition of these
                            tasks. WMSs are responsible for orchestrating their execution, respecting their flow and
                            control dependencies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Iterative:</strong> The different tasks that make up a workflow can also be executed
                            multiple times in an iterative way. At each iteration, tasks are executed, terminated, and
                            then wait to be invoked again.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data:</strong> The structure and execution of the workflow can also be driven by the
                            data flowing through the workflow components. These components are data operators that
                            remain alive while there is data to process.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Granularity</strong>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                        <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Some workflows can compose function calls to perform complex
                            processing tasks. To some extent, a script or a program can be seen as a workflow and a
                            runtime system as a workflow system.</li>
                        <li><strong>Standalone executables:</strong> The most common definition of a workflow is a
                            composition of standalone executables, which aggregate multiple function calls to perform
                            complex computations on a set of inputs and produce a set of outputs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sub-workflows:</strong> With the increase in scale and complexity of computational
                            problems, it is now common to express workflows as a hierarchical and modular composition of
                            sub-workflows.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Coupling</strong>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                        <li><strong>Tight:</strong> The tight coupling of some tasks indicates that these tasks must be
                            executed concurrently, being co-located on the same computing resources or running on
                            different sets of processors. This is often caused by periodic data exchanges between tasks
                            while they run.</li>
                        <li><strong>Loose:</strong> Conversely, a loose coupling of tasks does not impose any constraint
                            on the concurrent execution of tasks, giving more flexibility to the WMS when scheduling the
                            workflow.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Dynamicity</strong>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                        <li><strong>Branches:</strong> Dynamic workflows can comprise several conditional branches that
                            are activated or not depending on the realization of a predefined condition or triggered by
                            an external event. Such conditions can be related to changes observed in the processed
                            datasets, changes in resource status or availability, or time-related events.</li>
                        <li><strong>Runtime interventions:</strong> A second type of dynamic behavior found in workflows
                            is when a runtime intervention is needed. In that case, the workflow system gives the
                            control back to the user who started the workflow or to an automated external decision
                            process. Such interventions can modify the initial execution plan in different ways.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Domain</strong>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                        <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Some systems are deeply rooted in a scientific community and thus
                            mainly target domain-specific workflows.</li>
                        <li><strong>Agnostic:</strong> Others are more application-agnostic.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="row gy-4 mb-5">
            <a name="composition"></a>
            <h4>Composition</h4>
            <p>This axis addresses how workflows are defined, organized, and configured by WMSs. It explores the methods
                used to describe workflows, the level of detail required in these descriptions, and how complex
                workflows can be shaped from simpler components. This axis helps to understand how accessible and
                flexible different WMSs are for users with varying technical backgrounds.</p>
            <img src="/images/terminology/composition.svg" style="max-width: 700px;" />
            <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                <li><strong>Description Method</strong>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                        <li><strong>Schema:</strong> Refers to the case where the workflow is described in a text file,
                            using a specific format (e.g., XML, JSON, YAML, or a domain-specific language) and syntax.
                            <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                                <li><strong>Ad-hoc:</strong> The syntax used by a WMS is ad-hoc, meaning that it can
                                    only be understood by this particular WMS.</li>
                                <li><strong>Standard:</strong> Part of a common standard shared by multiple WMSs, such
                                    as the Common Workflow Language (CWL), the Interoperable Workflow Intermediate
                                    Representation (IWIR), or WfFormat.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>API:</strong> Includes WMSs that expose an API to describe workflows. This API
                            builds on or extends one or more popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) or a text
                            templating engine (e.g., jinja) to leverage loops and conditional statements and allow users
                            to describe their workflows in a more compact and flexible way.</li>
                        <li><strong>GUI:</strong> Corresponds to WMSs that rely on a graphical user interface.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Level of Abstraction</strong>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                        <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> A high-level abstract composition will only focus on describing
                            the logical structure of the task graph, a generic description of the data flowing through
                            the workflow, and the amount of resources required by each component. This abstract
                            description is generally independent of a specific instance of the workflow and of a
                            specific target computing and storage infrastructure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> Some systems have an intermediate-level abstract composition.
                            They allow for a high-level workflow description while requiring some execution details from
                            the users. Systems with intermediate-level abstraction provide users with a balance between
                            automation and manual fine-tuning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Concrete:</strong> A concrete composition is more closely related to an instance and
                            an infrastructure. All parameters are specified in the description, and the workflow can be
                            deployed and run directly from it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Implicit:</strong> When an API is used to describe a workflow, the composition is
                            implicit as the workflow's structure is derived from the composition of the different
                            function calls made by the user, or from metadata attached to a dataset to process.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Modularity</strong>

                            individual sub-workflows can be developed, tested, and optimized independently before

            <h4>Orchestration</h4>
            <p>This axis covers the implementation and execution management approaches for workflow components. It
                analyzes different methods for launching and coordinating tasks, from direct execution to more
                sophisticated approaches that leverage distributed resources, event-based triggers, or cloud services.
                These orchestration strategies determine how efficiently workflows use available computing
                infrastructure.</p>

            <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                <li><strong>Planning</strong>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                        <li><strong>Static:</strong> Some systems impose a static planning of the workflow execution,
                            i.e., all the decisions about when and where each task composing the workflow is executed
                            must be taken before the execution starts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dynamic:</strong> Conversely, some systems can make or adapt scheduling and resource
                            allocation decisions during the execution of the workflow, hence implementing a dynamic
                            planning strategy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Event-driven:</strong> The third category encompasses WMSs that do not plan the
                            workflow execution in advance but rather let the execution react to specific events and/or
                            conditions that occur at runtime. In such event-driven execution, when a trigger condition
                            or event is met, the workflow system automatically initiates subsequent, usually predefined,
                            actions such as starting new tasks, notifying users, and adjusting the resource allocation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Execution</strong>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                        <li><strong>Runner:</strong> The runner orchestration method refers to WMSs that are fully
                            responsible for the acquisition of computing and storage resources and the management of the
                            individual tasks that compose a workflow. It connects the high-level workflow definition to
                            the available resources. A runner system ensures that tasks execute in the correct order,
                            respecting their pre-defined control and flow dependencies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Resource Manager:</strong> Other WMSs delegate resource allocation and part of the
                            management of the execution of individual tasks to a resource manager. This orchestration
                            method is typically used in HPC systems where the allocation of compute nodes is handled by
                            a batch scheduler, or cloud systems, where container orchestration systems are used.</li>
                        <li><strong>Serverless:</strong> The last orchestration method relies on a serverless execution
                            of tasks. This refers to a cloud-based model in which the responsibility for infrastructure
                            management, allocation scaling, and job execution is entirely delegated to a cloud service
                            provider. A key distinction of this model is that the user or WMS must first define one or
                            more functions along with all of their software dependencies, and then the WMS may execute
                            those functions to carry out the workflow.</li>

            <h4>Data Management</h4>
            <p>This axis focuses on how data is handled throughout the workflow lifecycle. It characterizes methods for
                moving data between workflow components, approaches to storing data at different stages, and techniques
                for optimizing data access patterns. These data management strategies significantly affect workflow
                performance, especially for data-intensive applications.</p>

                <li><strong>Granularity</strong>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                        <li><strong>Batch:</strong> A common approach followed by many WMSs is to consider the data
                            operations of a workflow component at the granularity of a batch: all the needed input data
                            are consumed before performing computations and all the output data is produced, and made
                            available to subsequent components in the workflow, at the end of these computations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pipelined:</strong> Another approach is to consider a pipelined granularity in which
                            workflow components periodically produce and/or consume individual records during their
                            entire lifecycle. This is typically used to manage in situ processing workflows, where
                            analysis and visualization components are loosely coupled to a main data producer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Partitioned:</strong> A third intermediate granularity is to consider data as
                            partitioned, i.e., divided in groups of individual records, and to transfer these partitions
                            across the workflow. This approach is particularly useful when individual records are small.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Transport</strong>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                        <li><strong>File-based:</strong> A common approach is to rely on file-based transport, in which
                            a workflow component that produces intermediate data will write them into a file(s) on a
                            storage system. In contrast, a workflow component that consumes intermediate data will read
                            it from file(s).
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Streaming:</strong> An alternate approach is to directly stream intermediate data
                            between components.
                            <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                                <li><strong>In-memory:</strong> When the producer and consumer are co-located on the
                                    same node, data transport can be carried out in-memory through a shared address
                                    space.</li>
                                <li><strong>Network:</strong> Otherwise, it implies a network communication between the
                                    nodes that respectively hosts the data producer and consumer.</li>
                            </ul>

                <li><strong>Storage</strong></li>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                    <li><strong>File System</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                        <li><strong>Local:</strong> When workflow components are co-located on the same compute
                            node, the workflow system can leverage the existence of a local file system.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared:</strong> When components are allocated to different nodes of the
                            same compute cluster or to different clusters of the same computing facility, it
                            will have to rely on a shared file system. Commonly used in collaborative or
                            high-performance computing environments, shared file systems correspond to a
                            centralized model where data is accessible by multiple systems or nodes
                            simultaneously.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Distributed:</strong> In the extreme case where the execution of a workflow
                        is distributed over multiple computing facilities, this approach can leverage a
                        distributed storage space. This involves managing and storing data across multiple
                        local and/or remote systems, enabling scalability, load balancing, resilience, and
                        flexibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Replicated:</strong> Another common practice in distributed and shared
                        systems targeted by WMSs is the use of replicated storage, which focuses on creating
                        redundant copies of data to improve reliability, availability, and resilience.</li>

            <h4>Metadata Capture</h4>
            <p>This axis explores additional contextual information collected during workflow execution. It covers
                methods for tracking workflow execution state, documenting provenance, monitoring performance, and
                detecting anomalies. These capabilities ensure that workflows can be reliably executed, optimized,
                debugged, and reproduced.</p>
            <img src="/images/terminology/metadata_capture.svg" style="max-width: 700px;" />
            <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
                <li><strong>Provenance:</strong> A specific type of metadata that can be further decomposed into
                    prospective and retrospective provenance data. Prospective provenance corresponds to maintaining
                    detailed information about the workflow design and structure, the configuration of the workflow
                    system and the underlying computing and storage infrastructure, and the specific algorithms to be
                    used and their parametrization. Retrospective provenance data corresponds to what actually happened
                    to the data processed by a workflow and captures everything related to a specific execution. It is
                    usually extracted from execution logs to keep track of the data lineage (i.e., generation,
                    transformation, and usage) and timestamps and runtime details. Prospective provenance is essential
                    to facilitate reproducibility, while retrospective provenance is particularly useful for detecting
                    any deviation from the expected execution plan and is often used for debugging purposes.</li>

                <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Another type of metadata captured during workflow executions is
                    monitoring of data, which comes from processes that oversee the workflow execution in real time. The
                    data generated by monitoring provides critical insight into performance, resource utilization, and
                    potential bottlenecks. WMSs can leverage it to dynamically reconsider an initial execution plan by
                    modifying resource allocations or scheduling decisions. The monitoring data can also be analyzed by
                    researchers after a workflow execution to optimize the description of the workflow itself to improve
                    its efficiency.</li>

                <li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> We consider that a workflow management system supports anomaly
                    detection if it captures metadata that can be used to implement fault tolerance mechanisms. These
                    mechanisms vary in sophistication: Some systems terminate execution and display an error message,
                    while others complete the execution but log warnings about potentially incorrect data resulting from
                    unexpected behavior. There are even systems that can distinguish between anomalies that can be
                    handled automatically (e.g., task retries or by an optional branch from a task-failed trigger) and
                    anomalies that the workflow is not designed to handle and thus require user intervention.</li>
