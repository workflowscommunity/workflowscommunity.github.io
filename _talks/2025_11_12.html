Scientific workflows designed to handle massive datasets through distributed 
high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures or elastic on-demand 
computational services have established themselves as a robust and mature 
paradigm within data science. Within this context, one of the most 
consolidated production applications is the orchestration of environmental 
models for simulation and forecasting tasks.

<br /><br />

This presentation illustrates our perspective on workflows as essential 
building blocks for environmental systems, where numerical modeling is combined 
with artificial intelligence to strengthen forecasting and predictive 
capabilities. At the HPSC SmartLab of the University of Naples "Parthenope," 
we developed DAGonStar, a workflow engine designed to orchestrate environmental 
models used by the Center for Monitoring and Modeling Marine and Atmosphere 
(CMMMA) to produce weather and marine predictions.

<br /><br />

Among the laboratory's operational applications is MytilEx, a project funded by 
the Campania Regional Government, which aims to forecast E. coli contamination 
in cultivated mussels. The system improves pollutant transport and dispersion 
simulations (carried out with the WaComM++ model) by integrating an artificial 
intelligence module (AIQUAM++), trained on microbiological observations. 
Initial system evaluations reveal prediction accuracies above 90% for E. coli 
presence, a substantial step forward in applying computational intelligence to 
environmental and food safety domains.

<br /><br />

The same workflow building blocks that supported MytilEx have also enabled the 
development of two further projects. The first, MytilX—currently underway and 
funded by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Umbria e delle Marche 
"Togo Rosati"—has shown through preliminary experiments that the MytilEx 
success case can be replicated at other sites. The second, SmokeTracer, funded 
by the Campania Regional Government, is an on-demand HPC workflow aimed at 
estimating the potential soil contamination footprint caused by wildfires or 
arson. SmokeTracer has been implemented partly by reusing modules already 
available in the DAGonStar framework.
