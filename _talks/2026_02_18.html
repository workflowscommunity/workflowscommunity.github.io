As with many other areas of science, the quantity and quality of available 
cosmological data has exploded in recent years. This increase undoubtedly 
presents tremendous scientific opportunity. But accessing and analyzing this 
data at scale presents real challenges, especially for scientific users who 
are not familiar with HPC or big-data workloads.

<br /><br />

The OpenCosmo project exists to build a domain-specific abstraction layer on top 
of the cosmological datasets and computing resources housed at various DoE 
facilities. It aims to allow scientific users to describe which data they want 
and what analysis they would like to perform, without knowing or caring which 
facility the work is being performed at. The platform is a specific example of 
a more general trend towards "Science as a Service" tools that are cropping up 
in many different domains. Understanding the shared patterns and infrastructure 
needs of these tools is essential to ensure their viability and continued 
success.
