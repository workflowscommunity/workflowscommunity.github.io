            The Workflows Community Initiative (WCI) provides a common place for posting jobs related to workflows
            research and development. Note that WCI does not conduct job interviews or provide references to
            candidates. The goal of the jobs posting is to solely promote workflow-related job opennings to the
            workflows community.
        </p>

        <h2>Adding a Job Posting</h2>
        <p>
            At the WCI website, job opennings are described using a <a
                href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank">Markdown
                file</a>.
            The preferred way to submit your changes is via creating a pull request with the changes. To this end,
            these are the recommended steps for adding a job posting:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Fork</strong> the WCI GitHub repository</li>
            <li><strong>Clone</strong> your forked repository:
                <pre>git clone https://github.com/&#60;your_username>/workflowscommunity.github.io</pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Create</strong> a Markdown file under the <code>_jobs/</code> directory (e.g.,
                <code>my_institution_position_title.md</code>), and
                add the information regarding the job posting (see below how to structure your <code>.md</code> file).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Commit</strong> the changes, and create a <strong>pull request</strong> for the WCI GitHub
                repository.</li>
            <li>The WCI team will then evaluate your pull request, and merge the changes if the job posting information
                is properly documented.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <strong><i>Note:</i></strong> If you need to update the job posting, we recommend you to follow the same steps listed
            above, except instead of creating a new file you would edit your own file(s).
        </p>


        <h2>Creating your Markdown File</h2>
        <p>
            In the WCI website, each job posting is described in a separate Markdown file. Although we do not enforce a strict
            convention for the file name, we strongly encourage you to choose a unique and informative file name, such as 
            <code>my_institution_position_title.md</code>. If two positions have the file name, the newest one will be renamed 
            to avoid conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>The following example shows the structure of the Markdown file and summarizes the keywords that should be provided:
        </p>
        <pre>

        <p>
            WCI uses GitHub actions to build the job openning pages, which are currently processed at <strong>every 12
                hours</strong>.
