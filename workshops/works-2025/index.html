<meta name="description" content="Scientific workflows have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past several decades. Workflow management systems (WMSs) provide abstraction and automation that enable researchers to easily define sophisticated computational processes, and to then execute them efficiently on parallel and distributed computing systems. As workflows have been adopted by multiple scientific communities, they are becoming more complex and require more sophisticated workflow management capabilities. A workflow can now analyze terabyte-scale data sets; execute millions of individual tasks; coordinate heterogeneous resources and tasks from edge to core; and process near real-time data streams, files, and data placed in different types of storage systems. The computations can be single core workloads, loosely-coupled tasks, or tightly-coupled computations, and can run in heterogeneous distributed computing platforms all within a single workflow. The Workshop on Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science (WORKS) focuses on the many facets of scientific workflow composition, management, sustainability, and application to domain sciences in an increasingly diverse and a rapidly evolving technology landscape. WORKS aims to serve as the central meeting point for all the stakeholders involved in the evolving workflows community, and to showcase the latest developments and emerging approaches in the field. WORKS25 will be held in conjunction with the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC25) at the America’s Center Convention Complex in downtown St. Louis, Missouri (USA)." />

Scientific workflows have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past several decades.
Workflow management systems (WMSs) provide abstraction and automation that enable researchers
to easily define sophisticated computational processes, and to then execute them efficiently 
on parallel and distributed computing systems. As workflows have been adopted by multiple scientific communities,
they are becoming more complex and require more sophisticated workflow management capabilities. A workflow can now
analyze terabyte-scale data sets; execute millions of individual tasks; coordinate heterogeneous resources
and tasks from edge to core; and process near real-time data streams, files, and data placed in different types of storage systems.
The computations can be single core workloads, loosely-coupled tasks, or tightly-coupled computations,
and can run in heterogeneous distributed computing platforms all within a single workflow.
</p>
<p>
The Workshop on Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science (WORKS) focuses on the many facets of
scientific workflow composition, management, sustainability, and application to domain sciences in an increasingly
diverse and a rapidly evolving technology landscape. WORKS aims to serve as the central meeting point for all
the stakeholders involved in the evolving workflows community, and to showcase the latest developments
and emerging approaches in the field.
</p>
<p>
WORKS25 will be held in conjunction with the International Conference for
High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC25) 
at the America’s Center Convention Complex in downtown St. Louis, Missouri (USA).

<strong>Page limits include all figures, tables, references, and appendices.</strong>
</p>

<p>
All submissions will receive at least three reviews. All submissions will be single-blind peer reviewed.

<p>
Accepted <strong>full papers</strong> will receive a slot for an oral presentation and they will be included in the SC Workshop Proceedings.
</p>

<p>
Based on the content of the accepted <strong>abstracts</strong>, the Workshop Chairs will organize a Panel
discussion during the workshop centered around the topic of “Trailblazing vs. Time-Tested: Navigating the Future of Scientific Workflows”.
One author from each accepted abstract will participate in the panel discussion. 
<i>Accepted abstracts will not be included in the SC Workshop Proceedings. Unlike some of the previous editions of WORKS, abstracts will not be compiled into a full paper.</i>
