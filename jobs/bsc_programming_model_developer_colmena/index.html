<p>The Barcelona Supercomputing Center - Centro Nacional de Supercomputación (BSC-CNS) is the leading supercomputing center in Spain. It houses MareNostrum, one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe, and is a hosting member of the PRACE European distributed supercomputing infrastructure. The mission of BSC is to research, develop and manage information technologies in order to facilitate scientific progress. BSC combines HPC service provision and R&amp;D into both computer and computational science (life, earth and engineering sciences) under one roof, and currently has over 800 staff from 55 countries.</p>

<p>Look at the BSC experience:</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRkEii7OzRE">Let’s stay connected with BSC Folks!</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We are particularly interested for this role in the strengths and lived experiences of women and underrepresented groups to help us avoid perpetuating biases and oversights in science and IT research.</p>

<h2 id="context-and-mission">Context And Mission</h2>

<p>The Computer Sciences (CS) department of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center aims to carry out research and development to influence the way computing machines are built, programmed and used. The Workflows and Distributed Computing group at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center aims to carry out research on programming models for distributed computing. More specifically, this group will be contributing to the COLMENA project (Spanish funded project) which contributes to the definition of next-generation computing and data technologies by proposing a framework to ease the programming, deployment and maintenance of hyper-distributed applications on the device-edge-cloud Continuum.The group will have a significant effort devoted to the definition of the COLMENA programming model and its software platform.</p>

<p>The new programming model environment will be inspired on organic colonies: collections of autonomous individuals with heterogeneous characteristics that cooperate forming different social organizations. In this new approach, each smart device (IoT sensor/actuators, network access point/router or Edge/Cloud server) composing a cyber-infrastructure is considered as an Autonomous ageNT (ANT) aware of its own IT capabilities (data processing power, storage capacity, sensors and actuators equipped, available network interfaces, etc.) and context (geo-location, owner, etc.). In such an environment, services will be described as a society with different roles. Each role is defined by behaviour (program logic), the necessary software dependencies and the hardware requirements to play it. The role composition of such a society will be defined by a set of rules that indicate the number of players of each role. ANTs autonomously pick one or more roles to play according to its characteristics, the requirements of each role and the current role distribution. Upon their decision, they contextualize themselves downloading the necessary software and start the execution.</p>

<p>At any point, the infrastructure may change; a new ANT can join in or leave the Colony, the service may be in a peak or valley workload moment, or a network service may be disrupted. To rapidly adapt to these changes, ANTs constantly revisit their roles and consider any possible reconfiguration that may improve the service. The goal of the project is to develop a platform to create, deploy and operate services on the device-edge-cloud continuum. A programming framework capable of reducing the complexity of programming swarms. The “roles” will be programmable through simple, high-level programming interfaces, where no low level details are exposed. The project will also develop the necessary libraries and layers to support such an interface.</p>

<p>For this research, the group is looking for an engineer to design and implement the COLMENA programming model and software platform. The job also includes active participation in the project, attending project meetings, collaborating with partners and writing deliverables.</p>

<p>The financing entities are the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation and the European Union-NextGenerationEU, within the framework of the PRTR and the MRR, all in accordance with what is established in this regard, in particular, in accordance with the provisions of article 34.2 of Regulation (EU) 2021/241 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of February 12, 2021.</p>
